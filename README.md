# An example of using Scala.js with Mill, Vite, Laminar and Chart.js

A clone of the [code](https://github.com/sjrd/scalajs-sbt-vite-laminar-chartjs-example) from SÃ©bastien Doeraene's [Getting Started](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/tutorial/scalajs-vite.html) but using Mill as the build system.

The three main tags that exist in https://github.com/sjrd/scalajs-sbt-vite-laminar-chartjs-example for each phase of the [Getting Started](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/tutorial/scalajs-vite.html) examples have been created to help readers follow along.
